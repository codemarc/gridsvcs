# Scripts

This folder contains scripts that automate various tasks related to the project. In this project we have an opionated approach to scripting.

Scripting refers to writing small programs, known as scripts, to automate tasks that would otherwise be performed manually. Scripts are typically written in scripting languages, which are designed to be easy to write and understand. Common scripting languages include  Bash, JavaScript, Python and PowerShell.

#### Key Concepts of Scripting
  1. **Automation**: Scripts automate repetitive tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention and minimizing human error.  

  2. **Task-Specific**: Scripts are usually designed to perform specific tasks, such as file manipulation, system administration, or data processing.  

  3. **Interpreted**: Scripting languages are often interpreted rather than compiled, meaning they are executed directly by an interpreter without the need for a separate compilation step.  

  4. **Integration**: Scripts can integrate and orchestrate different software tools and systems, making them useful for tasks like deployment, configuration, and monitoring.  

  5. **Portability**: Scripts are often portable across different environments, provided the necessary interpreter and dependencies are available.


## Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice in DevOps and cloud computing where infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and automation, rather than through manual processes. This approach allows for more consistent, repeatable, and scalable infrastructure management.

In this project the scripts are used to automate the provisioning of cloud resources. The iac folder is used to provision the cloud resources. It is organezed by the cloud provider. Each folder contains a set of scripts that are used to provision the resources. Check the README.md files in each folder for more information.
